# Project Overview

This project, `erk-ai-playground`, is a Streamlit-based application showcasing experimental AI-powered features.

## Main Application
- The main entry point for the Streamlit application is `[app.py](mdc:app.py)`.
- Styling for the sidebar is managed by `[style_utils.py](mdc:style_utils.py)`.
- Streamlit application configuration can be found in `[.streamlit/config.toml](mdc:.streamlit/config.toml)` and secrets in `[.streamlit/secrets.toml](mdc:.streamlit/secrets.toml)`.
- Environment variables are loaded from `[.env](mdc:.env)`.

## Key Directories
- `pages/`: Contains subdirectories for different features accessible as Streamlit pages:
    - `opinion_classifier/`: Original opinion classification feature.
    - `opinion_classifier_v2/`: An updated version of the opinion classification feature.
    - `scenario_postulate/`: Feature for exploring future scenarios.
- `clients/`: Houses client modules for interacting with various AI APIs (Gemini, OpenAI, Perplexity).
- `services/`: Contains business logic and service integrations for features like opinion classification, translation, and scenario postulation.
- `db/`: Includes the SQLite database `[postulations.db](mdc:db/postulations.db)` used by the application.
- `testbench/`: Likely contains scripts for testing or experimenting with different project components.

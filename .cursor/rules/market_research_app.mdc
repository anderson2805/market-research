# Market Research Application Overview

This document outlines the functionality of the Streamlit-based market research application. The main application logic is managed within py files `services`, UI in `pages` folder and LLM clients in `clients` folder.

## Core Features

The application enables users to search for companies and related information using multiple AI-powered search engines: Gemini, Perplexity, and OpenAI.

### Input Methods

Users can provide company information in two ways:

1.  **Single Company Input:** A text input field allows users to enter the name of a single company for research.
2.  **Bulk Company Input:** Users can upload a CSV or Excel file containing a list of companies.
    *   If a file is uploaded, the application will prompt the user to specify which column in the file contains the company names.
3.  **Industries:** Focus the search on companies within specific industries.

### Search Filtering

To refine the search for related companies, users can specify:

*   **Country or Region:** Filter recommended companies based on their geographical location.


## Page Structure

The application is organized into several pages, as defined in `[app.py](mdc:app.py)`:

*   **Search Page (`pages/market_research/search.py`):** Contains the input fields for company names and search filters.
*   **Results Page (`pages/market_research/results.py`):** Displays the search results obtained from the different search engines.
*   **FAQ Page (`pages/market_research/faq.py`):** Provides answers to frequently asked questions about the application.
